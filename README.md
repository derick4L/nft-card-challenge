## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I'd say this project was pretty cut and dry. However, I did have bit of trouble implementing the hover state for the product image. What kept me stumped was the opacity. I applied opacity on hover and it kept changing all the elements under my image instead of just the image. To remedy this, I added a z-index to the image and it's hover effect. This allowed me to hover over the image and its opacity doesnt change the elements underneath.

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker by Google](https://g.co/kgs/GS2poQ) - In order to follow the style guide closely was possible. I used Color Picker widget, plugged in the color values given to me, and aliased the values in my global css.
- [W3 Schools <hr> tag overview](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp) - I worked with these tags before but I wanted to style it further. I used this site to review it's properties to see what I could style.
- [HTML Favicon Tutorial](https://careerkarma.com/blog/html-favicon/) - I needed a refresher to get the favicon up and running. This site helped me in a little under 2 mins.
